# Mapping Natural Disaster Risks


#### Problem Statement: 

The COVID-19 pandemic, in some areas of the globe, will exacerbate the ongoing risk/exposure to other natural disasters. There is little understanding of the coupling of the pandemic risk and the risk of these other occurrences. A case study will show, via geospatial analysis, an overlay of the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, drought, etc.



#### Executive Summary

This project seeks to create geospatial visualizations of natural disaster risks facing the U.S. and how these risks overlap with ongoing COVID-19 clusters. We extract historical data and aggregate at the county level to identify high-risk counties for various risks such as earthquakes, drought, wildfire, tornados, and hurricanes. We generate these layers in ArcGIS and identify key cities at elevated risk in an accompanying ArcGIS storyboard.

Master.ipynb synthesizes necessary code to generate county-aggregate layers imported into ArcGIS. The datasource for each layer is described within.
