Problem 16: Identifying Areas At Risk for COVID-19 and Other Natural Disasters

Problem Statement: The COVID-19 pandemic, in some areas of the globe, will exacerbate the ongoing risk/exposure to other natural disasters. There is little understanding of the coupling of the pandemic risk and the risk of these other occurrences. A case study will show, via geospatial analysis, an overlay of the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and the risk of floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, drought, etc.
